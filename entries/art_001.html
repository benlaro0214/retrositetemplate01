<h3 class="western">LINUX FOR THE MINIMALIST PART 1- SEPT 7TH 2021 
</h3>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>A simpler digital life? It's possible.</p>
<p>I would like to warn the one reading this that this book is NOT
for the novice user. If you are new at Linux, I suggest that you
might want to put my book aside for now. At the risk of sounding a
touch elitist, this is more for the seasoned user, whom of which is
more savvy with the command line, or wishes to sharpen their skills
at it.</p>
<p>However, for those who seek a bold change in their digital life,
this will be the book for you. In an age where we are constantly
being bombarded with advertisements, annoying pop-ups and malware,
the methods I will present to you will in fact demonstrate that it is
possible to navigate the web, connect with people, and do pretty much
the same as one does online, with the added bonus of not having to
deal with the cacophony that is today's on-line experience.</p>
<p>WHY CHOOSE LINUX?</p>
<p>While I am not a &quot;preacher&quot; for the Linux operating
system. I found that unlike some more commercial OS, one can
customize a system to fit one's needs. And even more so, one can go
even further and build a rather barebones system with a few CLI apps,
</p>
<p>Commercial OS' (as opposed to the various distributions of Linux,
which are open-sourced) also answer to business partners,
shareholders and other investors which makes them obligated to push
for advertisements, the promotion of consumerism, and basically the
exact opposite of minimalism.</p>
<p>Therefore, one method of releasing oneself from such rigid and
controlling trends, is not to segregate oneself from the internet,
but to adopt a different approach to access such information. One can
forgo the bells and whistles of everyday computing while gaining the
benefits of such access.</p>
<p>To give you an analogy, it is no different than to chose to ride a
bike to work, rather than either walk or take the car, to dress
oneself in simpler, more modest fashions as opposed to just either be
a slave to fashion or dressing one self &quot;a la second hand&quot;.</p>
<p>And so, in this blog, we will explore this minimalism that is one
part retrocomputing, one part digital housekeeping.</p>
