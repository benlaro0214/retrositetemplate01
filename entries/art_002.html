<br/>

</p>
<p>ONE YEAR WITHOUT A GUI!!</p>
<p>Over the years, I wanted to improve my skills at using the Command
Line Interface (a skill that most network administrators will tell
you is a must). As such, I went online and started to see what apps I
would use and what way I could practice.</p>
<p>Then I came across something called the 30 day CLI challenge. The
premise of it, is to only use CLI apps for day to day computing, from
editors, to browsers spreadsheets and the like.</p>
<p>While I couldn't just go CLI only for the job I had at the time, I
had a tiny netbook that I used for one year, living at the command
line for my own personal computing.</p>
<p>Personal computing, in many respects, is far more feature-hungry
than work computing. We use social media, watch videos, do personal
shopping and a whole host of other functions, such as gaming. As I
started to do this, I went cold turkey on that laptop, using the
command line only. I had to learn to connect to wifi using CLI alone.</p>
<p>I can assure you that connecting to a Starbuck's wifi using the
CLI is quite the challenge. Over time, I found other CLI apps that
enabled me to make the task a little less of a struggle.</p>
<p>As I progressed, I ended up with a small suite of CLI apps, but
also, I had developed an approach. Interestingly enough, I found
myself without the use of a mouse, completely discarding the use of
the trackpad. A keyboard is enough, and with the right
key-combination, navigating the web, and going about my day-to-day
computing was not only liberating, but also more focused.</p>
<p>I didn't have to put up with the clutter that modern websites
provide with ads and videos, hence I could focus on the content.
However, as liberating as it was, it was also a bit of a hassle to do
something as simple as watch a cat video or read a PDF</p>
<p>I guess we have taken for granted the simple concept of watching a
youtube video, how the modern browser takes on the task of serving as
video player, document viewer, graphics rendering and so on.</p>
<p>So, after unsuccessfully finding functional alternatives that were
not too time-consuming, I opted to go without them completely. 
</p>
<p>In many respects, I started to ponder about how to not only
progress, but also entertain myself. And entertainment I did find.
Some, would say I went &quot;Old School&quot; or &quot;retro&quot;.
Not really. It's just stuff that is still out there, such as the old
IRC servers, the old BBS and MUD's (the grand-father of MMO's).</p>
<p>I also re-discovered shoutcast and icecast servers, the names in
making online media possible. It was like driving up to that old
movie theatre that you remembered growing up and finding it waiting
for you.</p>
<p>I found it heartwarming, and it made me smile.</p>
