<h3 class="western">LINUX FOR THE MINIMALIST PART 3 : THE PROCESS OF
GOING MINIMAL - SEPT 9TH 2021 
</h3>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The first way: Gradual shedding.</p>
	<li><p>The second way: Transition.</p>
	<li><p>The Third way: Cold Turkey.</p>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>This is the part where there is this question &quot;where do I
begin to do so-and-so?&quot; in most how-to books. Well this is no
different. 
</p>
<p>The process of minimizing the OS to a barebones yet useful system
shares a basic philosophy with other forms of minimalism; A delicate
balance of simplicity and practicality. It is not just as simple as
saying &quot;to hell with XYZ app&quot;, but rather &quot;how can I
remedy the problems that XYZ app provided and simplify the matter&quot;.
</p>
<p>There are three ways to go about this;</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>METHOD I: Gradual shedding.</p>
<p>When one installs a distro of Linux these days, you will find that
there are a ton of apps and features. What is amazing, is that one
can uninstall many of these features and apps without &quot;breaking&quot;
the operating system.</p>
<p>And so, as you use a Linux distribution, you can gradually
uninstall the stuff you don't use or want. You can also begin
replacing certain apps with apps that are simpler and fit your needs.</p>
<p>When you boil it down to the bare necessities, a browser, some
text editor and a file manager is all you really need. Any extras app
you install, is up to the needs of the user.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>METHOD II: Transition.</p>
<p>Whereas the gradual shedding of unnecessary/unwanted software is a
slow process. Transitioning from a complex desktop to a more
streamlined version takes a little more effort and often takes some
&quot;re-learning&quot; of an environment.</p>
<p>For example, the whole idea of Windows Managers. At the core,
Linux has XORG and then it has the Windows Managers. There are
several ones that carry a very small footprint but also bring a whole
new level of minimalism that supersedes the gradual shedding of
unwanted apps.</p>
<p>These, will be explored in a later chapter, along some suggestions
of how to configure it so that it may be useful.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>METHOD III: Cold Turkey.</p>
<p>Just like some quit smoking, this one requires one to go with a
clean install of a barebones linux CLI. From there one can carefully
install the software that is wanted from scratch.</p>
<p>This methods will be discussed further in a later chapter, step by
step.
